# Git History Exploration

This repository is a small, intentional experiment to understand how Git commit
metadata (author date vs commit date) is interpreted and rendered by GitHub’s
contribution graph.

The goal is purely educational:
- Learn how Git records time-based metadata
- Understand GitHub’s contribution counting rules
- Explore how commit history affects visual contribution patterns

No production code lives here, and no activity is meant to imply real project
work or productivity.

This repo exists solely as a technical exploration of Git behavior.
